<p>Math 2710: Transition to Advanced Math<br />
Jeremy Teitelbaum<br />
Fall Semester, 2019</p>
<p><span><strong>Instructor</strong></span><br />
Jeremy Teitelbaum<br />

Office: Monteith 231<br />
Office hours: 9:00 - 10:00 Mondays, 12:15-13:00 Wednesdays (or by appointment)<br />
<span><strong>Course Description.</strong></span> This course is an introduction to mathematical proof, taught through examples mainly from algebra and number theory.</p>
<p><span><strong>Textbook:</strong></span> An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: Algebra &amp; Number Systems, by Gilbert and Vanstone. Pearson, New Jersey. ISBN 0-13-184868-2.</p>
<p><span><strong>Prerequisites.</strong></span> MATH 1132 or 1152. Cannot be taken for credit after passing MATH 2143, 3150, 3210, 3230, 3240, 3260, 3270, 3330, 3370 or 224.</p>
<p><span><strong>Piazza.</strong></span> We will be using the piazza Q&amp;A site for intra-class consultation. Questions about the course should be directed to the piazza site. Course resources are also available through piazza. You can access piazza through the Husky CT course for the class, but you should have received an email enrolling you in the class and providing a direct link.</p>


<p><span><strong>Assessment.</strong></span> Grades in this course will be based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">2</span> midterm exams, each worth <span class="math inline">25%</span> of the total grade. Tentatively scheduled for September 30 and November 5. Note: September 30 is Rosh Hashanah. If you are celebrating the holiday, <em>see me by September 20</em> to sign up for an alternate exam date, probably October 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Exam worth <span class="math inline">40%</span> of the final grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Homework and Participation (10%). I will assign a number of homework problems for discussion in each class, and you should do these homework problems before class and come prepared to discuss them. Periodically, I will select a subset of the assigned problems to be handed in. I will provide relatively little lead time for these assignments so it is in your interest to stay current. You may collaborate or use piazza when completing this work, but the final write-up must be your own work. In addition, I may from time to time make and grade other assignments including short in-class or online quizzes, and I will explain the rules for collaboration on those problems when they happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Piazza. Part of your homework and participation grade depends on your use of piazza. Prior to (most) classes, I will post a question or discussion topic to piazza pertaining to the next class. You should take the time to respond to these posts; each such question will count roughly the same as a typical homework problem or in-class quiz question.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Policy Statements</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></span></p>
<p>Students are bound by the university’s policies on academic integrity.</p>
<p><span><strong>Students with Disabilities</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Students with disabilities</em></span> should contact Teitelbaum as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations needed during the semester due to a documented disabilities. If you have a documented disability for which you wish to request academic accommodations and have not contacted the Center for Students with Disabilities, please do so as soon as possible.

<p><span><strong>Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Inappropriate Romantic Relationships</strong></span></p>
<p>The University is committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination or discriminatory harassment directed toward any person or group within its community – students, employees, or visitors. Academic and professional excellence can flourish only when each member of our community is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect. All members of the University community are responsible for the maintenance of an academic and work environment in which people are free to learn and work without fear of discrimination or discriminatory harassment. In addition, inappropriate Romantic relationships can undermine the University’s mission when those in positions of authority abuse or appear to abuse their authority. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, the University prohibits discrimination and discriminatory harassment, as well as inappropriate Romantic relationships, and such behavior will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University. More information is available at http://policy.uconn.edu/?p=2884.</p>
<p><span><strong>Sexual Assault Reporting Policy</strong></span></p>
<p>To protect the campus community, all non-confidential University employees (including faculty) are required to report assaults they witness or are told about to the Office of Diversity &amp; Equity under the Sexual Assault Response Policy. The University takes all reports with the utmost seriousness. Please be aware that while the information you provide will remain private, it will not be confidential and will be shared with University officials who can help.
