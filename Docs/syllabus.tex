{\bf Course Description.} This course is an introduction to mathematical proof, taught through examples mainly from
algebra and number theory.  

{\bf Textbook:} An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: Algebra \& Number Systems, by Gilbert and Vanstone. Pearson, New Jersey.
ISBN 0-13-184868-2.

{\bf Prerequisites.} MATH 1132 or 1152. Cannot be taken for credit after passing MATH 2143, 3150, 3210, 3230, 3240, 3260, 3270, 3330, 3370 or 224. 

{\bf Piazza.}  We will be using the piazza Q\&A site for intra-class consultation.  Questions about the course should be directed to the piazza site. Course resources are also available through piazza.  You can access piazza through the Husky CT course for the class, but you should have received an email enrolling you in the class and providing a direct link.

{\bf Assessment.}  Grades in this course will be based on the
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item $2$ midterm exams, each worth $25\%$ of the total grade.  Tentatively scheduled for
September 30 and November 5. Note: September 30 is Rosh Hashanah.  If you are celebrating the holiday, \textit{see me by September 20} to sign up for an alternate exam date, probably October 3.
\item Final Exam worth $40\%$ of the final grade.
\item Homework and Participation (8\%).   I will assign a number of homework problems for discussion in each class,
  and you should do these homework problems before class and come prepared to discuss them.  Periodically, I will
  select a subset of the assigned problems to be handed in.  I will provide relatively little lead time for these assignments so it is in your interest to stay current. You may collaborate
or use piazza when completing this work, but the final write-up must be your own work.  In addition, I may from time to time make and grade other assignments including short in-class or online quizzes, and I will explain the rules for collaboration on those problems when they happen.
\item Piazza participation (2\%).  Asking a mathematical question on piazza is worth $0.2\%$,
and answering one is worth $.5\%$.
\end{itemize}
