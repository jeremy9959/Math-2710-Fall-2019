<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the set of <em>eventually zero</em> sequences of non-negative integers <span class="math inline">\(a_1,a_2,\ldots\)</span>; eventually zero means that for each sequence <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> there is an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(a_i=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i\ge N\)</span>. (Informally, the sequence can have anything at the beginning but eventually it becomes <span class="math inline">\(0,0,0,\ldots\)</span>.) Then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is countable.</p>
<p>This is interesting because we know on the one hand that, for any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-tuples of non-negative integers <span class="math inline">\((a_1,\ldots, a_k)\)</span> is countable because it is a finite product of countable sets; and we know that the set of <em>all</em> sequences of non-negative integers <span class="math inline">\((a_1,a_2,\ldots)\)</span> is uncountable by the diagonalization argument. So <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a kind of intermediate case, but it turns out to be countable as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> First, let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{W}\)</span> be the set of non-negative integers and let <span class="math inline">\(A(n)\)</span> be <span class="math display">\[
A(n)=\overbrace{W\times W\times W\times \cdots\times W}^{(n-1)}\times \mathbb{N}
\]</span> For each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A(n)\)</span> is countable because it is a finite cartesian product of countable sets. For each <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;0\)</span> let <span class="math display">\[
f_{n}:\mathbb{N}\to A(n)
\]</span> be a bijection, and let <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> send <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to the zero sequence.</p>
<p>Now, let <span class="math inline">\(S(n)\subset S\)</span> be the subset of sequences whose last non-zero entry is in position <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (and let <span class="math inline">\(S(0)\)</span> be the zero sequence). Now each element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> belongs to exactly one <span class="math inline">\(S(n)\)</span> â€“ just choose the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> corresponding to the last non-zero entry in the sequence, or zero if the sequence is all zero. It suffices to prove that <span class="math inline">\(S^{*}\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with the zero sequence deleted, is countable.</p>
<p>To construct a bijection from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\to S^*\)</span>, first construct a bijection <span class="math inline">\(h:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to S^{*}\)</span> by sending <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_x(y)\)</span>. This is a bijection, since every <span class="math inline">\(s\in S\)</span> belongs to exactly one <span class="math inline">\(S(n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_n:\mathbb{N}\to S(n)\)</span> is bijective by construction.</p>
<p>Finally, since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\)</span> is countable, <span class="math inline">\(S^*\)</span>, and also <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, is countable.</p>
