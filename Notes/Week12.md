## Practice Problems for in-class work

#### Hammack, Section 12.2:

- Problem 18, then prove that $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality. (the relevant function is $f(n)=((-1)^n(2n-1)+1)/4$)

- Problems 11, 12: consider the functions $\theta(a,b)=(-1)^ab$ and $\theta(a,b)=a-2ab+b$ from from $\{0,1\}\times\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$.  Are they injective? surjective? bijective?

#### other problems

- Prove that if $g\circ f$ is injective, then $f$ is injective. Prove that if $g\circ f$ is surjective, then $g$ is surjective.
Give counterexamples showing that $g\circ f$ can be injective but $g$ not injective, and $g\circ f$ is surjective by $f$ is not surjective.

- Give an example of a countable subset of the irrational numbers, or prove that no such subset exists.

- Let $A$ be the set of sequences of natural numbers $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ that are eventually constant at zero -- in other words,
a sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ is in $A$ if there exists an $N$ such that $a_i=0$ for all $i\ge N$.  Is $A$ countable?

- How many surjective maps are there from a 3 element set to a 2 element set?  From a 4 element set to a 3 element set?

- Prove that the intervals  $(0,1)$ and $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ have the same cardinality for any $a,b$ with $b>a$.
