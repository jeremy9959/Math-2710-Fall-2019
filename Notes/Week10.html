<h1>Functions</h1>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A function <span class="math inline">\(f:A\to B\)</span> is a subset <span class="math inline">\(f\subset A\times B\)</span> with the property that for every <span class="math inline">\(a\in A\)</span> there is exactly one <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in f\)</span>. We write <span class="math inline">\(f:A\to B\)</span> to mean that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a function with domain <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and co-domain <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Compare this with the definition of a function as a “rule.” The associated “rule” says: to compute <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span>, find the (uniquely determined) pair <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and then set <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=b\)</span>.</p>
<p>In some sense this definition replaces the notion of a function with its graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-co-domain-range" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Domain, co-Domain, Range</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called the <strong>DOMAIN</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is called the <strong>CO-DOMAIN.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>range</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the subset of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> that occur in a pair <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in f\)</span>.</p>
<p>A function can be drawn as a graph or as a “mapping” between two sets (see figure 12.3 in Hammack).</p>
</div>
<div id="examples" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Consider problem 1 from Hammack. <span class="math inline">\(A=\{0,1,2,3,4\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B=\{2,3,5,6\}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f=\{(0,3),(1,3),(2,4), (3,2), (4,2)\}\)</span> Verify that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a function and then find its range.</p>
<p>Is the subset of pairs of integers <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(3x+y=4\)</span> a function from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<div id="terminology-injective-and-surjective" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Terminology: injective and surjective</h1>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A function is <em>injective</em> if it has the property that <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\not=f(b)\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(a\not=b\)</span>. (or <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=f(b)\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(a=b\)</span>). A function is <em>surjective</em> if for every <span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span> there is an <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in f\)</span>. A function is <em>bijective</em> if it is both injective and surjective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Injective</em> is also called “one-to-one.” <em>Surjective</em> is also called “onto.”</p></li>
<li><p>Surjectivity depends on the codomain (you can shrink the codomain to make the function surjective).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="some-examples" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Some examples</h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(n,m)=2n-4m\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This function is not injective because <span class="math inline">\(f(n,m)\)</span> is always even; so for example <span class="math inline">\(f(n,m)=1\)</span> has no solution. It is not injective because <span class="math inline">\(f(4,2)=f(0,0)=0\)</span> so there are two different elements <span class="math inline">\(a=(4,2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b=(0,0)\)</span> in the domain with <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=f(b)\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{Q}-\{2\}\to\mathbb{Q}-\{5\}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=(5x+1)/(x-2)\)</span> is bijective.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check surjectivity, you have to show that, if <span class="math inline">\(y\in \mathbb{Q}-\{5\}\)</span>, then the equation <span class="math inline">\((5x+1)/(x-2)=y\)</span> has a solution <span class="math inline">\(x\in \mathbb{Q}-\{2\}\)</span>. Set <span class="math inline">\(x=(-2y-1)/(-y+5)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(y\not=5\)</span>, this makes sense for any <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the codomain. Also the function on the right is never equal to <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, so the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is in the domain of the function.</p>
</div>
<div id="more-examples" class="slide section level2">
<h1>more examples</h1>
<ul>
<li>Consider maps from <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}\)</span>. how many are there? How many are injective? How many surjective? How many bijective?</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a function is determined by its values on each element in the domain. To count the functions, you can send each of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to any of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>; so you have three choices of three things, for a total of <span class="math inline">\(27=3^3\)</span> functions. If the function is injective, then <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> need to go to different things, so you have three choices for where to send <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> choices for where to send <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and then <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> goes to whatever is left. That’s a total of <span class="math inline">\(3\times 2\times 1 =6\)</span> injective functions. If the function is surjective, then something has to hit <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> – there are three choices; something has to hit <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> – there are two choices left – and then whatever you haven’t used must hit <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. So again there are <span class="math inline">\(3\times 2\times 1=6\)</span> maps. Implicit in this is the fact that in this case the surjective, injective, and bijective functions are all the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="connection-to-number-theory" class="slide section level2">
<h1>connection to number theory</h1>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> The function <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{Z}_m\to \mathbb{Z}_m\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=ax\)</span> is bijective if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>First suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)=1\)</span>. We show that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=ax\)</span> is injective. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(y)\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(ax\equiv ay\pmod{m}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)=1\)</span> we can cancel the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and see that <span class="math inline">\(x\equiv y\pmod{m}\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective (congruence means equality in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_m\)</span> ). To show that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective, we must show that we can solve the equation <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=y\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(y\in \mathbb{Z}_m\)</span>. This is the equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ax\equiv y\pmod{m}\]</span></p>
<p>and by the theorem on linear congruences this has a solution when <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)=1\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore if <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)=1\)</span> the map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective and injective and thus bijective.</p>
</div>
<div id="number-theory-continued" class="slide section level2">
<h1>number theory continued</h1>
<p>Now we show that if the function is bijective then <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)=1\)</span>. It’s a little easier to assume instead that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)\not=1\)</span> and prove that the function is not bijective. For this we can give counterexamples. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(d=\mathrm{gcd}(a,m)\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(k=m/d\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(k\not\equiv 0 \pmod{m}\)</span> (since <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(k&lt;m\)</span>.) But <span class="math inline">\(ak=am/d=(a/d)m\equiv 0\pmod{m}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(f(k)=f(0)\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(k\not=0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_{m}\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not injective. In fact, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not surjective either. Since <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;1\)</span>, by the theorem on congruences we cannot find <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathbb{Z}_{m}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(ax\equiv 1\pmod{m}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is not in the range of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="number-theory-continued-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>number theory continued</h1>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong>Let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be integers with <span class="math inline">\(b\not=0\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\)</span> be the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)=ax+by\)</span>. Then the range of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the set of <span class="math inline">\(n\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(d=\mathrm{gcd}(a,b)\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a restatement of (a part of) the theorem on linear diophantine equations. The range of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the set of integers <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)=A\)</span> has a solution; and the theorem on diophantine equations tells us that this equation has a solution exactly when <span class="math inline">\(d|A\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="composition-of-functions" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Composition of functions</h1>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f:A\to B\)</span> is a function and <span class="math inline">\(g:B\to C\)</span> is a function. The <em>composition</em> <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span> is a function from <span class="math inline">\(A\to C\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\((g\circ f)(a)=g(f(a))\)</span>.</p>
<p>This makes sense because <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\in B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g:B\to C\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g:\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(g(x)=\sin(x)\)</span>. What are <span class="math inline">\(f\circ g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A=\{0,1,2,3\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B=\{1,2,3,4\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C=\{1,3,5,6\}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(f=\{(0,1),(1,2), (2,3),(3,3)\}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A\times B\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(g=\{(1,3), (2,3),(3,3),4,3)\}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(B\times C\)</span>. What is the composition?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="properties-of-composition" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Properties of composition</h1>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Composition of functions is associative.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(f:A\to B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g:B\to C\)</span> are injective then <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span> is injective. Similarly if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are surjective then <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span> is surjective. And if both are bijective, so is the composition.</p>
<p>Let’s verify that if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are injective then so is <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(g(f(x))=g(f(y))\)</span>. Then by injectivity of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(y)\)</span>. By injectivity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(x=y\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span> is injective.</p>
<p>The converse is false. Let <span class="math inline">\(A=\{a,b\}\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(B=\{0,1,2\}\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(C=\{u,v\}\)</span>. Define <span class="math inline">\(f:A\to B\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(b)=1\)</span>. Define <span class="math inline">\(g:B\to C\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(g(0)=u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(1)=v\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(2)=v\)</span>. Now <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span> sends <span class="math inline">\(a\to u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\to v\)</span> so it is injective; but <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is not injective.</p>
<p>There is a partial converse:</p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(g\circ f\)</span> is injective, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective. If <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span> is surjective, then <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is surjective.</p>
</div>
<div id="linear-algebra" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Linear algebra</h1>
<p>Someone asked in class about linear maps <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbf{R}^{M}\to\mathbf{R}^{N}\)</span>. In linear algebra you learned about the <em>rank</em> and the <em>nullity</em> of a linear map (or a matrix). The <em>rank</em> is the dimension of the range of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The nullity is the dimension of the null space of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. An important basic theorem about linear maps is that <em>rank</em> plus <em>nullity</em> is the dimension of the domain of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>The null space of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the space of vectors that map to zero under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> were injective, then the only value that can map to zero is zero, so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective if and only if its nullity is zero.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective, then its range must be equal to its codomain, so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective if and only if the rank of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is bijective, then its rank must be <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and its nullity must be zero; but this requires that <span class="math inline">\(m=n\)</span>. So a linear map is bijective if <span class="math inline">\(m=n\)</span> and its nullity is zero or its rank is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
