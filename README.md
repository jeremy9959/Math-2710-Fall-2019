### Euclidean Algorithm (from Euclid)

Euclid's algorithm is laid out in [Proposition 1](https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII1.html)
and [Proposition 2](https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html) of Book VII of Euclid's Elements.

For week 8, we will also rely on selected sections from [The Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf)
by Richard Hammack.  In particular:

- Section 13.1 (The Triangle Inequality)
- Section 13.7 (Sequences)
- Section 13.8 (Series)

and the associated problems.

For Weeks 10-11, we will also rely on Hammack's Chapter 12 and 14 (in addition to Chapter 6 of Gilbert-Vanstone).
