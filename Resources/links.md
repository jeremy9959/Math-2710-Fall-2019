- [Mathematical Reasoning](https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=books){target="blank"} by Ted Sundstrom is another textbook that is available for free and is a useful resource.

- [The Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf){target="blank"} by Richard Hammack is another freely available text.  We will refer to the discussion of sequences in this text.

- [Russell's Paradox](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-russells-paradox/){target="blank"} is a famous
observation of Bertrand Russell that illustrated that naive notions of "sets" lead to logical contradictions.
Famously, Russell's work destroyed the life work of [Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege)
who had hoped to reduce arithmetic to logic.
