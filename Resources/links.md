- [Russell's Paradox](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-russells-paradox/){target="blank"} is a famous
observation of Bertrand Russell that illustrated that naive notions of "sets" lead to logical contradictions.
Famously, Russell's work destroyed the life work of [Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege)
who had hoped to reduce arithmetic to logic.
