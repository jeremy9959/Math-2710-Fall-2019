title: Homework

I will assign problems for class discussion every day.  You should 
do the listed problems **before** the corresponding class so that you are prepared to
discuss them.

Periodically I will select a subset of the problems I have
assigned to be handed in.  The selected problems will be announced with a relatively short
lead time.  Thus it is in your interest to stay current on the homework.
