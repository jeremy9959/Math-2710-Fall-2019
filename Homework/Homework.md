\renewcommand{\pmod}[1]{(\mod #1)}

I will assign problems for class discussion every day.  You should 
do the listed problems **before** the corresponding class so that you are prepared to
discuss them.

Periodically I will select a subset of the problems I have
assigned to be handed in.  The selected problems will be announced with a relatively short
lead time.  Thus it is in your interest to stay current on the homework.

**Chapter 5 and [The Book Of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf)**

- Oct 21: Hammack pg. 264: 1,3,8,9
- Oct 23: Hammack pg. 264: 4,5,7,10,11 
- Oct 25  Hammack pg. 264 14. pg. 268. 1, 2.

Additional Problems:

- Prove that if $p$ is prime then $\binom{p}{r}$ is divisible by $p$.  Use this to prove that $n^p\equiv n\pmod{p}$ for all $n$
and any prime number $p$.

- Let $f(x)=(1+x)^{n}$.  Prove that the $i^{th}$ derivative 
$$
f^{i}(x)=\frac{n!}{(n-i)!}(1+x)^{n-i}
$$
and therefore $f^{i}(0)=n!/(n-i)!$.
Taylor's formula says that
$$
(1+x)^{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{f^{i}(0)}{i!}x^{i}
$$
while the binomial theorem says that
$$
(1+x)^{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\binom{n}{i}x^{i}.
$$
Use these facts to conclude that $\binom{n}{i}=\frac{n!}{(n-i)!i!}$
