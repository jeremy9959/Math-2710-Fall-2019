<p>I will assign problems for class discussion every day. You should do the listed problems <strong>before</strong> the corresponding class so that you are prepared to discuss them.</p>
<p>Periodically I will select a subset of the problems I have assigned to be handed in. The selected problems will be announced with a relatively short lead time. Thus it is in your interest to stay current on the homework.</p>
